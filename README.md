`powl_bot.py` is a bot that manages discord polls. It can create polls, keep track of polls already created, tracking status and various statistics (like majority option and percentage of users in the server that voted). It can also export poll data as a file.
`roblin.py` is a bot whose utility is to check a website for new articles and send a notification on a specific channel in a server, however most of the code is dedicated to interacting with the discord users in a funny (maybe annoying) way

Both bots feature an interactive menu for settings and a variety of commands.
